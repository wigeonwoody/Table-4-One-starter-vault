#WORLD_GEN
Let’s work together to design a ==location/culture/faction/mystery/setting== for my solo RPG campaign.

I’ll start by sharing what I have in mind, and I’d like you to ask me questions, offer suggestions, and help me flesh out the details.

As we go, please prompt me for my preferences, challenge my ideas, and help me explore different possibilities.

Let’s build this element step by step, discussing its appearance, history, key NPCs, conflicts, and anything else that comes up.

Ready? Here’s my initial idea: ==your idea or inspiration==. What do you think, and where should we start?
