Shortcuts for Adventure Crafter.  Adventure Crafter is a system to create coherent story beats through randomization and tables.  It was designed by Tana Pigeon.  You can find more info about Adventure Crafter at [wordmill games](http://wordmillgames.com/the-adventure-crafter.html).

This shortcut-file has a tutorial video available:
- [Using the "adventurecrafter" shortcut-file to play with AdventureCrafter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z922-50K-o) (runtime 7:29)

Uses __lists.sfile__ shortcut-file (required).
This requires that __lists.sfile__ comes before __adventurecrafter.sfile__ in the shortcut-list.
Adds and uses lists for plotlines and characters.

Uses __state.sfile__ shortcut-file (optional).
It uses this to save & load the theme order and final theme switch state.

Uses __mythicv2.sfile__ or __mythicgme.sfile__ shortcut file (optional).
If __mythicv2.sfile__ or __mythicgme.sfile__ is available, then the plotlines and characters lists will be created to reference the __mythicv2.sfile__ or __mythicgme.sfile__ lists.
This requires that __mythicv2.sfile__ or __mythicgme.sfile__ comes before __adventurecrafter.sfile__ in the shortcut-list.

The time limit does not need to expire within this Turning Point and could extend beyond it further into the Adventure, but it should terminate within this Adventure to give the Characters a reason to accomplish the task.

This results automatically in a New Character." ],

This result differs from Hidden Agenda, where in Hidden Agenda the Character may legitimately have both motives in mind, whereas in Fraud the image or story they are presenting is completely fake.
