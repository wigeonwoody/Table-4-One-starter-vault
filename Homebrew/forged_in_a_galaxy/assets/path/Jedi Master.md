# Jedi Master

Force Disciplines:
You are a paragon of the Jedi Order, wielding the Force with mastery, insight, and restraint. Your presence inspires others, and your connection to the Force is profound.

## Abilities
- [x] **Force Foresight:** When you reach out with the Force to sense danger, hidden truths, or the emotions of others, add +2 and take +2 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit, you may _Ask the Oracle_ for a vision or insight, and clear 1 stress or aid an ally with +1 momentum.
- [ ] **Force Command:** When you attempt to influence the thoughts or actions of another (Jedi Mind Trick or persuasive presence), roll +heart or +wits. On a hit, you may compel them as if you rolled a strong hit. On a strong hit, you may also clear 1 stress or grant an ally +2 momentum. On a miss, the target resists and you must _Face Danger_ as the Force warns of consequences.
- [ ] **Force Mastery:** When you use the Force to move objects, leap great distances, or defend yourself (telekinesis, Force jump, Force push/pull), roll +wits. On a strong hit, achieve your goal and take +3 momentum. On a weak hit, you succeed but mark 1 stress or attract significant attention. On a miss, the Force is disrupted and you must _Pay the Price_.
