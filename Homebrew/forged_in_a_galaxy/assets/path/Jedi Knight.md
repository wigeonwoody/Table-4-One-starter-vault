# Jedi Knight

Force Disciplines: 
You are trained in the ways of the Force, able to sense, influence, and defend with your will.

## Abilities

- [x] **Force Awareness:** When you reach out with the Force to sense danger, hidden truths, or the emotions of others, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit, you may also _Ask the Oracle_ for a vision or insight.
- [ ] **Force Influence:** When you attempt to influence the thoughts or actions of another (Jedi Mind Trick), roll +heart. On a hit, you may compel them as if you rolled a strong hit. On a weak hit, mark 1 stress. On a miss, the target resists and you attract unwanted attention.
- [ ] **Force Mastery:** When you use the Force to move objects, leap great distances, or defend yourself (telekinesis, Force jump, Force push/pull), roll +wits. On a strong hit, achieve your goal and take +2 momentum. On a weak hit, you succeed but mark 1 stress or attract attention. On a miss, the Force slips from your grasp and you face a new threat.
