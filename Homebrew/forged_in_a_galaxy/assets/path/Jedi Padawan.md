# Jedi Padawan

Force Disciplines: 
You are an apprentice in the ways of the Force, learning to sense, influence, and defend under the guidance of a mentor.

## Abilities
- [x] **Force Sensitivity:** When you reach out with the Force to sense danger, hidden truths, or the emotions of others, add +1. On a hit, take +1 momentum. On a strong hit, your mentor (or the Oracle) offers guidance or insight.
- [ ] **Tentative Influence:** When you attempt to influence the thoughts or actions of another (Jedi Mind Trick), roll +heart. On a hit, you may compel them as if you rolled a weak hit. On a strong hit, you may instead compel as if you rolled a strong hit, but mark 1 stress. On a miss, the target resists and you lose 1 momentum.
- [ ] **Unsteady Mastery:** When you use the Force to move small objects, leap short distances, or defend yourself (telekinesis, Force jump, Force push/pull), roll +wits. On a strong hit, achieve your goal. On a weak hit, succeed but mark 1 stress or lose 1 momentum. On a miss, the Force slips from your grasp and you must _Pay the Price_.
