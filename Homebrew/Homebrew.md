### Jedi Padawan

- If you fall to the dark side, this asset may be replaced with a Dark Side Padawan counterpart.

### Jedi Master
- When you mark all three abilities, you may call upon the Force for legendary feats, but each time you do, mark 2 stress (reflecting the immense strain and responsibility).
- If you ever fall to the dark side (by choice or through narrative), this asset may be replaced with a Dark Side Master counterpart.
