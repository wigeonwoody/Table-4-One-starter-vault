Welcome to your RPG Campaign Vault! This vault is designed to help you plan, run, and record your tabletop adventures with ease and consistency. Each campaign begins as a fully equipped template, providing you with structure, notes, and tools to keep your world organized and your stories alive.

# ⚙️ How to Create a New Campaign Vault

1. **Open Obsidian’s Vault Browser**  
    From the Obsidian home screen, open the vault menu (the left sidebar or top-right vault selector).
    
2. **Duplicate the Template Vault**  
    Locate the **Template Campaign** vault in your list.  
    Right-click (or use the menu icon) and choose **“Make a copy.”**
    
3. **Rename the New Vault**  
    Give your new vault a clear campaign name — for example:  
    `Starforged_Del_Elshm_Campaign` or `Jedi_Archives_Operation`.
    
4. **Open and Customize**
    
    - Launch your new vault.
        
    - Update the campaign metadata in the `00_Setup` or `Campaign Overview` note.
        
    - Adjust folders, tags, and plugin settings if needed.
        
    - Begin outlining your story!
        
5. **Start Creating**  
    Use the included templates (Session Notes, NPCs, Locations, Moves, etc.) to start building your adventure. Each campaign vault is your own self-contained world — so make it your own.
