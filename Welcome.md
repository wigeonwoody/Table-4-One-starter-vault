# Welcome to Table-4-One

Pull up a chair, set your dice within reach, and open your mind to adventure—Table-4-One is your personal, ever-expanding GM’s and player’s binder, reimagined for the digital age.

This vault is crafted for solo and co-op roleplaying, blending the tactile joy of campaign journaling, the utility of a rules compendium, and the creative spark of adventure generation—all within a single, organized space. Whether you’re voyaging among the stars in Starforged, or delving the dungeons of D&D, Table-4-One is your companion at every turn.

Here, the boundaries between player and game master blur. An integrated AI chatbot stands ready as your co-player, oracle, rules assistant, and narrative engine. It helps weave stories, answer questions, and organize your campaigns—so you can focus on the journey, not the paperwork.
