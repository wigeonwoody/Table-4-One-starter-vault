### 🗒️ Notes Directory

The **Notes** directory is the scratchpad and thinking space of the vault. It holds **daily notes**, **loose thoughts**, and **rough ideas** that haven’t yet been developed into structured documents or formal entries elsewhere.

Use this space for:

- ✍️ **Daily notes and logs** — quick entries, session recaps, or planning for the day.
- 💭 **Rambling ideas** — unfiltered brainstorming, half-formed thoughts, or freewriting.
- 🧠 **Research fragments** — snippets, quotes, or references captured before they find a permanent home.
- 🔄 **Idea incubation** — concepts that may later be promoted into the main vault or linked to specific campaigns.

Think of this folder as your **mental workspace** — a flexible, messy area where ideas live before they’re ready to be organized. Everything here is _in progress_ and _exploratory_.
